## About

I'm a solopreneur and a dad to two girls. Been building websites to make a living since I dropped out of college way back in '02. I've launched like over a hundred sites, most of which are now gone, but these are the ones still kicking around:

[jQueryScript](https://www.jqueryscript.net/): A jQuery Plugin & Webdev resource website.

[CSSScript](https://www.cssscript.com/): A JavaScript/CSS website.

[ScriptByAI](https://www.scriptbyai.com/): A free AI resource website.

[CuratifyAI](https://www.curatifyai.com/): A Curated AI website.

[TitanUI](https://www.titanui.com/): A free graphic design resource website.

And many small niche websites.
